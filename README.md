Set-Up
---

- Copy `.env.example` to `.env` in the root of the project and edit all `REPLACE` values with sensitive configuration obtained from `positron-staging`. This should help.

```
heroku config --app=positron-staging | grep -E `cat .env.example | grep REPLACE | cut -f1 -d= | xargs | tr ' ' \|` | sed -e 's/:\ /=/g' | sed -e 's/ //g'
```

### Via Docker Compose
- Install [Docker for Mac](https://docs.docker.com/docker-for-mac/install/)
- `git clone git@github.com:<your username>/positron.git && cd positron`
- `docker-compose up`

This starts a new self-contained Docker instance that boots MongoDB, ElasticSearch and Node. Changes made to source-code located in `api` and `client` is [automatically reloaded](https://github.com/artsy/positron/blob/master/boot.js#L34) on browser-refresh; no need to restart the process.

To shut down the process, press `ctrl+c` or execute `docker-compose down`.

### Manually

- Install [NVM](https://github.com/creationix/nvm)
- Install Node 6

```
nvm install 6
nvm alias default 6
```

- Fork Positron to your Github account in the Github UI.
- Clone your repo locally (substitute your Github username).

```
git clone git@github.com:craigspaeth/positron.git && cd positron
```

- Install node modules

```
yarn install
```

- Positron uses MongoDB as a database. To install MongoDB using homebrew do the following, if you would prefer to install manually check the documentation at [MongoDB](http://docs.mongodb.org/manual/tutorial/install-mongodb-on-os-x/)

```
brew install mongodb
```

- Start the MongoDB database

```
mongod
```

- Install and run elasticsearch

```
brew install elasticsearch
brew services start elasticsearch
```

- Start the server

```
yarn start
```
- Positron should now be running at [http://localhost:3005/](http://localhost:3005/), open a browser and navigate to it. That will redirect you to staging, login as an Artsy administrator and it will redirect you to `http://localhost:3005` logged into Writer with the default partner gallery channel (David Zwirner).

- Run tests

```
yarn test
```

- Make sure you have mongo running in the background or most tests will not work.

Debugging
---

### Server side
Start the server using
```
yarn dev
```
This will start the server on port `3005` with `inspect` option.

- In your Chrome go to: [Chrome Inspect](chrome://inspect)
- Under Remote Target now you should see `./index.js`, click on `inspect` link below it which will open a Chrome developer tools.

Now anywhere in your server side code you can put `debugger` and you should be able to debug.
