Through the Nita Mukesh Ambani Cultural Centre (NMACC), launched in 2023, she has created a landmark institution that brings together visual art, performance, and design under one roof. “When I envisioned an interdisciplinary space like the NMACC, my intent was to not only spotlight India’s vibrant art history, but also offer a global platform to the existing cultural zeitgeist of the country,” she told Artsy in a <a href="https://www.artsy.net/article/artsy-editorial-nita-mukesh-ambani-spectacular-new-arts-institution-mumbai">2024 interview</a>.</p><p>Since its opening, the institution has introduced Indian audiences to major international presentations, including <a href="https://www.artsy.net/artist/yayoi-kusama">Yayoi Kusama</a>’s <em>Infinity Room</em>, shown in India for the first time. Its four-story Art House has hosted a series of large-scale exhibitions, among them, <em>“</em>Sangam/Confluence<em>”</em> curated by Ranjit Hoskote and Jeffrey Dietch, which brought together leading voices of the East and West in a notable cross-cultural dialogue.</p><p>The centre has equally placed emphasis on the performing arts by hosting popular musicals such as <em>Mamma Mia!</em> alongside opera, theatre, and dance, reinforcing its interdisciplinary mandate.</p><p>Ambani’s patronship of the arts has extended far beyond the country with recent exhibitions such as <em>“</em>Tree &amp; Serpent: Early Buddhist Art in India, 200 BCE–400 CE” at the <a href="https://www.artsy.net/partner/the-metropolitan-museum-of-art">Metropolitan Museum of Ar</a>t, which traced the origins of Buddhist art. This outlook was further reinforced by her daughter, Isha Ambani, who most recently chaired the <a href="https://www.artsy.net/partner/british-museum">British Museum</a> gala, positioning Indian patronage within an international institutional context.</p><p><br></p>'

The Indian market, as Asokan shares, “is at a moment of consolidation and growing confidence.” </p><p>“We are seeing a more informed collector base, greater transparency, and stronger alignment between primary-market growth and institutional validation,” she said. “Looking ahead, I see the market moving toward measured, thoughtful, and sustainable growth: fewer speculative spikes, stronger networks across the region, and a clearer articulation of South Asian artistic narratives within the global context.”</p><p><br></p>'

It has played a crucial role in launching the careers of artists such as S.H. Raza, <a href="https://www.artsy.net/artist/tyeb-mehta">Tyeb Mehta</a>, and <a href="https://www.artsy.net/artist/bhupen-khakhar">Bhupen Khakhar</a>, among many others. Over more than 35 years in the art world, Gandhy has built a life shaped by enduring relationships. </p><p>Her role has rarely been limited to that of a dealer. It is, instead, a constant negotiation between professionalism and “oftentimes counsellor and the conduit between the artist and the world outside of it.” If she had to define it, she says, it comes down to responsibility—“to the artist, to the collector who buys, and to the world that looks at what you present.”</p><p>Looking at the art world today, Gandhy sees India as “its own bubble—of immense faith in what is familiar.” Beneath the noise of auctions, she finds reassurance in the primary market’s quieter rhythms, shaped by restraint, care, and long-held trust.</p><p><br></p>'

The exhibition traces the artist’s trajectory to his centenary, including his pioneering 1952 journey to Mexico.</p><p>“We’re always looking to the West, but we shouldn’t. We have nearly two billion people—this is where buying, selling, enjoying, and understanding art should happen, on a Friday night at home,” she said. “Just like Hindustani music or Indian cinema, success has to happen here first.” </p><p><br></p>'

        body: '<p>One of India’s most prominent collectors, Kiran Nadar is a pioneer in transforming the country’s institutional standing. </p><p>Nadar founded the Kiran Nadar Museum of Art (KNMA) in 2010, and the institution has since charted a new course for modern and contemporary art in India. As the country’s first private museum of its kind, it offers free access to world-class exhibitions, bringing South Asian art to the public while asserting its presence on the global stage. “KNMA was born from a desire to share my collection with a wider public and from a realization that India had no institutional spaces that promoted art visibility,” she told Artsy. </p><p>In the late ’80s, Nadar set out to buy some art for her house, acquiring works by four artists: <a href="https://www.artsy.net/artist/rameshwar-broota">Rameshwar Broota</a>, <a href="https://www.artsy.net/artist/mf-husain">M.F. Husain</a>, <a href="https://www.artsy.net/artist/manjit-bawa">Manjit Bawa</a>, and <a href="https://www.artsy.net/artist/krishen-khanna">Krishen Khanna</a>. Before long, she recalls, “I had more work than I could put up, and thought I should do something more meaningful with my collection.” </p><p>The museum—which is set to launch a new space spanning 1 million square feet—has mounted seminal shows of artists including <a href="https://www.artsy.net/artist/gulam-mohammed-sheikh">Gulammohammed Sheikh</a>, <a href="https://www.artsy.net/artist/vivan-sundaram">Vivan Sundaram</a>, and <a href="https://www.artsy.net/artist/nasreen-mohamedi">Nasreen Mohamedi</a>. Nadar’s support has also extended far beyond the New Delhi museum: At the <a href="https://www.artsy.net/article/artsy-editorial-artists-announced-venice-biennale-2024-will-spotlight-queer-indigenous-names">2024 Venice Biennale</a>, the museum presented “The Rooted Nomad: M.F. Husain” at Magazzini del Sale. It is set to return to the upcoming <a href="https://www.artsy.net/article/artsy-editorial-venice-biennale-2026-announces-curator-koyo-kouohs-theme-in-minor-keys">Venice Biennale</a> later this year, supporting a new exhibition by <a href="https://www.artsy.net/artist/nalini-malani">Nalini Malani</a>. </p><p>“It brings me immense joy to help democratize art, transforming it into a shared cultural experience rather than an exclusive privilege,” she said. “What’s particularly encouraging is seeing young collectors enter the art world—not just as buyers, but as an interactive audience engaging meaningfully with the art.” </p><p><br></p>'
